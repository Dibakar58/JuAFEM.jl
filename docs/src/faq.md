What's the difference between JuAFEM.jl and traditional FEM?

> Using programming languages such as C/C++ or Fortran , to achieve efficient computing, high demand of programming skills is required. In recent years, MATLAB and Python become popular. Although their code is more readable, but in general it is quite computationally
expensive .
JuAFEM has a clear structure, all callers are constructed in a modular way, and each calculation step has a high degree of
customization, which is characterized by high efficiency and brevity. Meanwhile, JuAFEM has competitive computational
efficiency.
